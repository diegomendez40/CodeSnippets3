### 301 - Witch Jobsite (Spring Boot, MongoDB, SwaggerUI)

A Spring Boot+MongoDB backend for a 'Flamenco Witches' jobsite.

You just need to add your MongoDB connection data and it should work properly (SwaggerUI is configured to help you test the API).

### 302 - Leetcode (Java, speed-optimal)

Some Java solutions of mine for Leetcode problems. I strive for speed-optimal solutions (in terms of execution time).
