### 301 - Witch Jobsite (Spring Boot, MongoDB, SwaggerUI)

A Spring Boot+MongoDB backend for a 'Flamenco Witches' jobsite.

You just need to add your MongoDB connection data and it should work properly (SwaggerUI is configured to help you test the API).

### 302 - Leetcode (Java, speed-optimal)

Some Java solutions of mine for Leetcode problems. I strive for speed-optimal solutions (in terms of execution time).

### 303 - Library Managers (Java, JUnit, different approaches)

Different designs for library managers, including some designs set in the FlamencoWitches universe.

### 304 - Puzzles (Java, JUnit, different approaches)

Coding challenges, some of which might have been created by myself. Solutions are mine, possibly suboptimal in the salient aspect, and certainly not optimal in *every* aspect.
